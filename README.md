Searching for Images using Google Search

The App is to search for the images using Google API search. We can also place some filters on the images like Image Type, Image Size..etc

It took me 7 Hours to complete this project.

User Stories Completed:

User can enter a search query that will display a grid of image results from the Google Image API.
User can click on "settings" which allows selection of advanced search options to filter results
User can configure advanced search filters such as:

    Size (small, medium, large, extra-large)
    Color filter (black, blue, brown, gray, green, etc...)
    Type (faces, photo, clip art, line art)
    Site (espn.com)

Subsequent searches will have any filters applied to the search results
User can tap on any image in results to see the image full-screen
User can scroll down “infinitely” to continue loading more image results (up to 8 pages)
